# Covid19 Detection Using Machine Learning
## Introduction
This Repository consists of my Innovation Lab Project **Covid19 Detection Using Machine Learning**.The project aims to accuratley classify whether a patient is  Covid19 positive or negative, using Multi Modal Machine Learning Model.The Modalities used here are X Rays, CT Scans and Clinical Data. The repository has the following contents:
### 1)Dataset
### 2)Implementations
### 3)Model Pipeline

## Dataset
Three Different Modalities are used for the model: X Rays, CT Scans and Clinical Data. Each Modality has been pre procesed and divided into training and test dataset.
The dataset compostion is:<br>
### Training Dataset

| Modality      |   Covid  | Non-Covid |
|---------------|----------|---------- |
| X Ray         |   3038   |    308    |
| CT Scan       |   3038   |    308    |
| Clinical Data |   3038   |    308    |

### Testing Dataset

| Modality      |   Covid  | Non-Covid |
|---------------|----------|---------- |
| X Ray         |   760    |    525    |
| CT Scan       |   760    |    525    |
| Clinical Data |   760    |    525    |

## Implementations
All the code has been written in python language and using pytorch framework.
